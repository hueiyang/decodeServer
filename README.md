# decodeServer
Decode sensor device packet on UDP server.

# Usage
Because I havenâ€™t studied RESTful API thoroughly yet, I use the console to show my result temporarily.

You can type "show" or "quit" on console when the decodeServer is running.
1. Type 'show' will show all result in JSONArray.
2. Type 'quit' will close the server.
3. Type others will do nothing.
